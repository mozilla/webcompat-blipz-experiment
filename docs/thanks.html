  <h1>Thank you!</h1>
  <p>
    Firefox would like to make sure all websites work well for all users. Your feedback helps us<br/>
    understand how we are doing, and if there are any issues we need to fix or report to the site.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can report sites that aren't working well by clicking on the <img src="broken_page.svg" alt="broken page" /> icon.<br/>
    With your help we'll make browsing the web with Firefox better for many more users.
