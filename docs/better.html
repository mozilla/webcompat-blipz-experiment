  <h1>Making the Web Better, Together</h1>
  <p>
    Firefox would like to make sure all websites work well for all users. Your feedback helps us<br/>
    understand how we are doing, and if there are any issues we need to fix or report to the site.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are currently running an experiment to see if we can gather more feedback from users.<br/>
    Thank you for taking the time to help us make Firefox better!
